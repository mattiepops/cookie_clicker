# Cookie Clicker Project
___________

Wecome ***Kelian*** and/or ***Emily*** to my masterpiece! :bowtie:

Please find the **cookie clicker project link** [here] (https://mattiepops.github.io/cookie_clicker/).


### Reason for this project:
________

We were told to become familiar with React.js and Parcel by creating a cookie clicker game. 

This project was built using HTML, SCSS, JS and react library.

## What did we do:

I created a clicking game. If you click on the cookie you get 1 cookie. You can keep clickin forever. You can also use your cookies to buy clikcing upgrades.

### What did we learn from this experience:

I learned the syntax of React, and certain differences of JS and React, such as the DOM and the virtual DOM that React operated on.

I also became more familiar with how to use the React library, and I became familiar with using different components. 


## Problems encountered:

I had some issues with bundling documents together in different folders. If i tried to put all the files in the 'src' folder, then I was not able to successfuly launch **npm start**.


### Conclusion
_____

I created a little game where you can click to mine cookies and buy upgrades to generate more cookies.

Thank you for reading this readme and giving me feedback on the project :punch:
